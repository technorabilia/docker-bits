# [Sabnzbd](http://sabnzbd.org/) makes Usenet as simple and streamlined as
# possible by automating everything we can. All you have to do is add an .nzb.
# SABnzbd takes over from there, where it will be automatically downloaded,
# verified, repaired, extracted and filed away with zero human interaction.
