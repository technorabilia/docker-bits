# [Davos](https://github.com/linuxserver/davos) is an FTP automation tool that
# periodically scans given host locations for new files. It can be configured
# for various purposes, including listening for specific files to appear in the
# host location, ready for it to download and then move, if required. It also
# supports completion notifications as well as downstream API calls, to further
# the workflow.
