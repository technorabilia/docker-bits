# [Ngircd](https://ngircd.barton.de/) is a free, portable and lightweight
# Internet Relay Chat server for small or private networks, developed under the
# GNU General Public License (GPL). It is easy to configure, can cope with
# dynamic IP addresses, and supports IPv6, SSL-protected connections as well as
# PAM for authentication. It is written from scratch and not based on the
# original IRCd.
