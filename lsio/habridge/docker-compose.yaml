# [Habridge](https://github.com/bwssytems/ha-bridge/) emulates Philips Hue API
# to other home automation gateways such as an Amazon Echo/Dot Gen 1 (gen 2 has
# issues discovering ha-bridge) or other systems that support Philips Hue. The
# Bridge handles basic commands such as 'On', 'Off' and 'brightness' commands of
# the hue protocol. This bridge can control most devices that have a distinct
# API.
