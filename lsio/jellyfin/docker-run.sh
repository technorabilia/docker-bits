# [Jellyfin](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin) is a Free Software Media
# System that puts you in control of managing and streaming your media. It is an
# alternative to the proprietary Emby and Plex, to provide media from a
# dedicated server to end-user devices via multiple apps. Jellyfin is descended
# from Emby's 3.5.2 release and ported to the .NET Core framework to enable full
# cross-platform support. There are no strings attached, no premium licenses or
# features, and no hidden agendas: just a team who want to build something
# better and work together to achieve it.
