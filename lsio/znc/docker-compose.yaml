# [Znc](http://wiki.znc.in/ZNC) is an IRC network bouncer or BNC. It can detach
# the client from the actual IRC server, and also from selected channels.
# Multiple clients from different locations can connect to a single ZNC account
# simultaneously and therefore appear under the same nickname on IRC.
