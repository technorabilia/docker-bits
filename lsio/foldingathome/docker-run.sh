# [Folding@home](https://foldingathome.org/) is a distributed computing project
# for simulating protein dynamics, including the process of protein folding and
# the movements of proteins implicated in a variety of diseases. It brings
# together citizen scientists who volunteer to run simulations of protein
# dynamics on their personal computers. Insights from this data are helping
# scientists to better understand biology, and providing new opportunities for
# developing therapeutics.
