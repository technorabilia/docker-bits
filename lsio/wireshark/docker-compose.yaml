# [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) is the world’s foremost and widely-
# used network protocol analyzer. It lets you see what’s happening on your
# network at a microscopic level and is the de facto (and often de jure)
# standard across many commercial and non-profit enterprises, government
# agencies, and educational institutions. Wireshark development thrives thanks
# to the volunteer contributions of networking experts around the globe and is
# the continuation of a project started by Gerald Combs in 1998.
