# [Sealskin](https://github.com/selkies-project/sealskin/) is a self-hosted,
# client-server platform that enables users to run powerful, containerized
# desktop applications streamed directly to a web browser. It uses a browser
# extension to intercept user actions—such as clicking a link or downloading a
# file and redirects them to a secure, isolated application environment running
# on a remote server.
