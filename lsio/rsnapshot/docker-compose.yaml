# [Rsnapshot](http://www.rsnapshot.org/) is a filesystem snapshot utility based
# on rsync. rsnapshot makes it easy to make periodic snapshots of local
# machines, and remote machines over ssh. The code makes extensive use of hard
# links whenever possible, to greatly reduce the disk space required.
