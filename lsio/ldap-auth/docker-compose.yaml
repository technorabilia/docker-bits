# [Ldap-auth](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-ldap-auth) software is for
# authenticating users who request protected resources from servers proxied by
# nginx. It includes a daemon (ldap-auth) that communicates with an
# authentication server, and a webserver daemon that generates an authentication
# cookie based on the user’s credentials. The daemons are written in Python for
# use with a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) authentication server
# (OpenLDAP or Microsoft Windows Active Directory 2003 and 2012).
