# [Heimdall](https://heimdall.site) is a way to organise all those links to your
# most used web sites and web applications in a simple way. Simplicity is the
# key to Heimdall. Why not use it as your browser start page? It even has the
# ability to include a search bar using either Google, Bing or DuckDuckGo.
