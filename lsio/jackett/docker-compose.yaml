# [Jackett](https://github.com/Jackett/Jackett) works as a proxy server: it
# translates queries from apps (Sonarr, SickRage, CouchPotato, Mylar, etc) into
# tracker-site-specific http queries, parses the html response, then sends
# results back to the requesting software. This allows for getting recent
# uploads (like RSS) and performing searches. Jackett is a single repository of
# maintained indexer scraping & translation logic - removing the burden from
# other apps.
