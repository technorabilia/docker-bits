# [ScummVM](https://www.scummvm.org/) is a program which allows you to run
# certain classic graphical adventure and role-playing games, provided you
# already have their data files. The clever part about this: ScummVM just
# replaces the executables shipped with the games, allowing you to play them on
# systems for which they were never designed! ScummVM is a complete rewrite of
# these games' executables and is not an emulator.
