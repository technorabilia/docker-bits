# [Lidarr](https://github.com/lidarr/Lidarr) is a music collection manager for
# Usenet and BitTorrent users. It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new tracks
# from your favorite artists and will grab, sort and rename them. It can also be
# configured to automatically upgrade the quality of files already downloaded
# when a better quality format becomes available.
