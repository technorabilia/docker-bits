# [Ombi](https://ombi.io) allows you to host your own Plex Request and user
# management system. If you are sharing your Plex server with other users, allow
# them to request new content using an easy to manage interface! Manage all your
# requests for Movies and TV with ease, leave notes for the user and get
# notification when a user requests something. Allow your users to post issues
# against their requests so you know there is a problem with the audio etc. Even
# automatically send them weekly newsletters of new content that has been added
# to your Plex server!
