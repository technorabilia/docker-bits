# [Remmina](https://remmina.org/) is a remote desktop client written in GTK,
# aiming to be useful for system administrators and travellers, who need to work
# with lots of remote computers in front of either large or tiny screens.
# Remmina supports multiple network protocols, in an integrated and consistent
# user interface. Currently RDP, VNC, SPICE, SSH and EXEC are supported.
