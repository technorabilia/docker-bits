# [WebCord](https://github.com/SpacingBat3/WebCord) can be summarized as a pack
# of security and privacy hardenings, Discord features reimplementations,
# Electron / Chromium / Discord bugs workarounds, stylesheets, internal pages
# and wrapped https://discord.com page, designed to conform with ToS as much as
# it is possible (or hide the changes that might violate it from Discord's
# eyes).
