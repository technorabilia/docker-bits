# [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) gives you access to all your files
# wherever you are. Where are your photos and documents? With Nextcloud you pick
# a server of your choice, at home, in a data center or at a provider. And that
# is where your files will be. Nextcloud runs on that server, protecting your
# data and giving you access from your desktop or mobile devices. Through
# Nextcloud you also access, sync and share your existing data on that FTP drive
# at the office, a Dropbox or a NAS you have at home.
