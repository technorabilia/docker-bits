# [Sonarr](https://sonarr.tv/) (formerly NZBdrone) is a PVR for usenet and
# bittorrent users. It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new episodes of your
# favorite shows and will grab, sort and rename them. It can also be configured
# to automatically upgrade the quality of files already downloaded when a better
# quality format becomes available.
