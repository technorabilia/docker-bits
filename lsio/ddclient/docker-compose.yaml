# [Ddclient](https://github.com/ddclient/ddclient) is a Perl client used to
# update dynamic DNS entries for accounts on Dynamic DNS Network Service
# Provider. It was originally written by Paul Burry and is now mostly by
# wimpunk. It has the capability to update more than just dyndns and it can
# fetch your WAN-ipaddress in a few different ways.
