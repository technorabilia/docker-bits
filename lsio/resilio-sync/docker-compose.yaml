# [Resilio-sync](https://www.resilio.com/individuals/) (formerly BitTorrent
# Sync) uses the BitTorrent protocol to sync files and folders between all of
# your devices. There are both free and paid versions, this container supports
# both. There is an official sync image but we created this one as it supports
# user mapping to simplify permissions for volumes.
