# Docker scripts for LinuxServer.io Docker containers

These scripts can be used to easily deploy [LinuxServer.io Docker containers](https://hub.docker.com/u/linuxserver/) with predefined settings.

The scripts are based on data provided by the [LinuxServer.io GitHub repositories](https://github.com/linuxserver).

Please keep the following in mind.
* The scripts are not supported by LinuxServer.io
* The scripts are being generated so I cannot accept requests to add scripts

Detailed information about installing and using the scripts and more can be found [here](https://www.technorabilia.com/docker-scripts-for-linuxserver-io-docker-containers).
